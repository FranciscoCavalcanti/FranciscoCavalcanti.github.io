## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.ufpe.br/'>Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE)</a> since 2023. Previously, I had a wealth of experience as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Economics of <a style='color: black;' href='http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/'>PUC-Rio</a> (2018-2023) and Operational Coordinator at <a style='color: black;' href='http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/datazoom/index.html'>Data Zoom</a> (2019-2023). I earned my Ph.D. from the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/'>Universitat de Barcelona</a> (2018), and my academic journey includes both a Master's (2012) and Bachelor's degree from <a style='color: black;' href='https://sites.google.com/view/pimes/'>PIMES/UFPE</a> (2010).


## Research Focus

My academic interests are intersections between Political Economy, Development Economics, Public Economics, and Environmental Economics. As an applied economist, I like to address questions arising from hypotheses in theoretical models and employ quantitative methods with microdata to conduct my analyses. Essentially, my commitment is to elucidate the complexities of these fields and apply my conclusions to contribute to implementing policies that promote social and economic development.
