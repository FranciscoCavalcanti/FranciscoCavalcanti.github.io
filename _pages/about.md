## About me

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.ufpe.br/'>Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE)</a> since 2023. I earned my Ph.D. from the Universitat de Barcelona (2018), and my academic journey includes both a Master's (2012) and Bachelor's degree from <a style='color: black;' href='https://sites.google.com/view/pimes/'>PIMES/UFPE</a> (2010).

I also bring a wealth of experience as a dedicated researcher, having previously served as a post-doctoral researcher at the <a style='color: black;' href='http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/'>Department of Economics</a> of PUC-Rio (2018-2023) and operational coordinator at <a style='color: black;' href='http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/datazoom/index.html'>Data Zoom</a> (2019-2023).


## Research interests

My academic pursuits revolve around the intersections of Political Economy, Development Economics, and Environmental Economics. I am deeply committed to unraveling the complexities of these fields and applying my findings to contribute meaningfully to policy implications that foster both social and economic development.
